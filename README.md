# Trade execution and automation using Python & C++.

## A functional Trade execution sample project, integrating API endpoints to get live ticker prices and Selenium automation sign-ins.

## This sample project was built as a simple execution engine to showcase the following:
* How to effectively use REST APIs to GET information from endpoints using Python.
* How to automate web functionality for faster and easier access using Selenium.
* How to pass information from a REST API in Python to C++, by exposing C++ code to Python using pybind11 bindings.
* How to use OOP and C++ concepts effectively: inheritance, encapsulation, classes, objects, templates, etc.
* How to create and run threads in C++.

## BUILT WITH
* Python
* C++
* Pybind11
* CMAKE
* REST API
* Selenium and Google Chrome for web automation

## GETTING STARTED
* This section will describe how to get the project running on your local machine.
  
### Prerequisites
* Local Machine using a terminal running Linux (This assumes you have Python3 installed)
* Alternatively, you can run a Python venv. follow the steps here: (https://medium.com/@lucasthedev/a-comprehensive-guide-to-python-virtual-environments-with-venv-cb76fea6a550)
   ```
   $ mkdir -p <name of directory>
   $ git clone https://github.com/aquist0295/BuySellProcessor
   ```
* Docker (a linked display to the container is required if using a Docker container and Selenium Chrome)
* Below are resources to help you get started with docker and docker-desktop.
   * For Mac: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/
   * For Windows: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/

     
### INSTALLATION & USAGE
* Update config.ini with CONSUMER_KEY & CONSUMER_SECRET NB: an Etrade account is required. Using an editor of your choice(i.e nano, vim, visual-studio) - For this tutorial, i will use vim, since it's available in most Linux distributions. 
  ```
  $ vim /BuySellProcessor/pythonFiles/config.ini
  
  >> CONSUMER_KEY = < Enter CONSUMER_KEY here >
  >> CONSUMER_SECRET = < Enter CONSUMER_SECRET here >
  ```
* Update sign_in_automation.py with Etrade username and password. This will automate sign-in. NB: Etrade's MFA authentications will send a token to the phone number associated with your account during the sign-in process.
  ```
  $ vim /BuySellProcessor/pythonFiles/sign_in_automation.py

  >> user_input.send_keys("") # Enter with your username
  >> password_input.send_keys("") # Enter with your password
  ```  
* Run the application
  ```
  $ cd < top directory from the prerequisites section >
  $ python3 pythonFiles/python_client.py
  ```
* MFA authentication: You should see the output below in the terminal. Enter the MFA code sent by Etrade to your phone number here and press ENTER.
  ```
  $ Please enter mfa verification code from your device: < Enter code sent to your phone number here >
  ```
